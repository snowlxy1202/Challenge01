# Challenge01
Challenge Project for Week1

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Semantic Changes 
1. Change "hero" class name to "background-image" class since the name "hero" doesn't represent the element well. 

2. change <div class="header"> to <header>, change CSS selector accordingly.

3. change <div class="footer"> to <footer>, change CSS selector accordingly.

4. change <div> in header to <nav>, change CSS selector accordingly. 

5. Change "title" from "website" to "horiseon official website" 

Accessibility Changes:

1. add alternative to all meaningful pictures and icons
